# Prometheus Monitoring Extension for AppDynamics

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring solution for collecting and aggregating metrics as time series data.
Programs designed to provide metrics to Prometheus (called "exporters") listen for HTTP requests and emit
metrics. Prometheus periodically connects to the endpoint and scrapes the metrics.

This extension will scrape one or more Prometheus endpoints and ingest selected metrics into AppDynamics.
